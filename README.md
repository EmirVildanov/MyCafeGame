## MyCafe Game

<!-- Description -->
Game included using of PostgreSQL and WPF .Net Core app.  
  
At university I had a homework on my DBMS lesson where I needed to create db for project named "MyCafe".
You may see it's description in [Link to db creation file](sql/CafeDbCreation.sql) and [Link to db tasks file](sql/HomeworkTasks.sql).  
  
As an optional task we were offered to
create a simple project over created db to test
how working with db's looks like in real life.  
  
So I decided to make a simple game over it:
